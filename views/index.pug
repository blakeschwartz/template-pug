            This application is a collection of examples on various web technologies. It is designed 
            so that any page can be directly editied and displayed without compilation or further
            processing. The source material is either process in the browser or is processed by
            the server on the fly.

            * [**Pug**](https://pugjs.org), formally Jade, an HTML processor.
            * [**Stylus**](http://stylus-lang.com), a CSS processor.
            * [**Markdown**](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), a markup language.
            * [**Babel**](https://babeljs.io/), an [ES2015](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) 
            * [**CoffeeScript**](https://coffeescript.com/) 

            This application was built as a platform for working out quick solutions to problems 
            that may require several of these technologies.
